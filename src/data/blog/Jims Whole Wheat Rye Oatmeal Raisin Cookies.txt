Jim's Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin Cookies


1 stick (113 grams) unsalted butter
3 Tablespoons (40 grams) coconut oil
1 cup (200 grams) white granulated sugar
1 egg
1 Tbsp water
1 tsp salt
100 grams golden raisins
100 grams oat flour (oatmeal blended in the Oskar)
50 grams rye flour
100 grams whole wheat flour (may need extra to get the right consistency of fresh ground hamburger)
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp powdered ginger
1/2 tsp ground allspice
1/2 tsp nutmeg

Directions: 

Cream butter and coconut oil with sugar (by hand with a Danish whisk if possible) until well blended and creamy
Add egg and mix well.  
Add spices and mix well. 
Add raisins and mix well.   
Add flours a little at a time until consistency of freshly ground hamburger is reached.  
Drop portions of about 1 tbsp on a nonstick cookie sheet and press down slightly with your hand to flatten a bit. 
Bake cookies ta 325F for about 14 minutes or until golden brown on the edges. The center may be a bit lighter and that is OK.  Remove from oven and allow to cool for 3 minutes. Once cooled use a spatula to transfer them to a wire rack to retain crispness.

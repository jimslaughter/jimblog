Hello everyone!  Labor Day is behind us and now it's on to fall.  Fall Watch has begun. That's where you wait and wait for the first day with a nice cold snap in the air and then you declare that fall has arrived.  Right now it is hot so that declaration is not close at hand.  

It's exciting to have my new blog up and running.  I'm trying to get the workflow figured out, and photos also.  All in good time.
